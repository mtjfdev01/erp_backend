# Accounts and Finance Daily Reports Migration

## Overview
This migration restructures the accounts-and-finance module to follow the same pattern as the store module, creating a dedicated `accounts_and_finance_daily_reports` submodule.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Module Structure
- Created `accounts_and_finance_daily_reports/` directory
- Moved entity, DTOs, service, and controller to the new module
- Updated routes to `/accounts-and-finance/reports/*`

### 2. Files Created
```
accounts_and_finance_daily_reports/
├── entities/
│   └── accounts-and-finance-daily-report.entity.ts
├── dto/
│   ├── create-accounts-and-finance-daily-report.dto.ts
│   └── update-accounts-and-finance-daily-report.dto.ts
├── accounts-and-finance-daily-reports.service.ts
├── accounts-and-finance-daily-reports.controller.ts
└── accounts-and-finance-daily-reports.module.ts
```

### 3. Database Changes
- New table: `accounts_and_finance_daily_reports`
- Same structure as original `accounts_and_finance` table
- Added proper indexing for performance

### 4. API Endpoints
- `POST /accounts-and-finance/reports` - Create new report
- `GET /accounts-and-finance/reports` - Get all reports
- `GET /accounts-and-finance/reports/:id` - Get specific report
- `PATCH /accounts-and-finance/reports/:id` - Update report
- `DELETE /accounts-and-finance/reports/:id` - Delete report

## Migration Steps

### 1. Database Migration
```sql
-- Run the migration script
source migration-accounts-and-finance-daily-reports.sql;
```

### 2. Data Migration (Optional)
If you have existing data in the `accounts_and_finance` table:
1. Uncomment the data migration section in the SQL script
2. Run the migration again
3. Verify data integrity

### 3. Frontend Updates
Update all frontend components to use the new API endpoints:
- Change from `/accounts-and-finance` to `/accounts-and-finance/reports`
- Update any hardcoded API calls

### 4. Testing
- Test all CRUD operations with the new endpoints
- Verify data migration (if applicable)
- Test error handling and validation

## Benefits

1. **Consistent Structure**: Follows the same pattern as store module
2. **Better Organization**: Clear separation of concerns
3. **Improved Maintainability**: Modular structure makes code easier to maintain
4. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks with logging
5. **Better Performance**: Proper database indexing

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, you can rollback by:

1. **Revert Code Changes**:
   - Restore the original `accounts-and-finance.module.ts`
   - Remove the new `accounts_and_finance_daily_reports` directory
   - Revert any frontend changes

2. **Database Rollback**:
   ```sql
   -- Drop the new table
   DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `accounts_and_finance_daily_reports`;
   
   -- The original table remains unchanged
   ```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create new accounts and finance daily report
- [ ] Fetch all reports
- [ ] Fetch single report by ID
- [ ] Update existing report
- [ ] Delete report
- [ ] Error handling for invalid IDs
- [ ] Validation of required fields
- [ ] Date formatting and validation
- [ ] Number field validation
- [ ] Frontend integration (if applicable)

## Notes

- The original `accounts_and_finance` table remains intact during migration
- Old controller and service are commented out but not deleted
- New module exports the service for potential reuse
- All error handling includes proper logging
- Database indexes are added for better query performance

## Next Steps

1. Update frontend components to use new endpoints
2. Test thoroughly in development environment
3. Deploy to staging for additional testing
4. Monitor logs for any issues
5. Consider removing old table after successful migration
